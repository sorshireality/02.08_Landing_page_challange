                    Oslo is the largest city in Norway, and it has been the country's capital since 1814 following the dissolution of the union with Denmark.

                    Oslo has a great location at the head of the Oslofjord, surrounded by forested hills. Even in the city centre, the nearest park is never more than a few blocks away.

                    Oslo is the natural hub of national and international travel in Norway. The Government and Parliament are located here, and at the end of Oslo's main street, Karl Johans gate, you will find the Royal Palace. In 2007 Reader's Digest ranked Oslo as number two on a list of the world's greenest and most pleasant cities to live in!

                    The city offers an abundance of attractions, shopping options and a flourishing cultural life, and a choice of restaurants which is almost unparalleled in Scandinavia. A ten-minute boat ride from the centre takes you to lovely beaches on the islands in the Oslofjord.
